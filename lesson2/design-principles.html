            <p class="type-info">Apple's website uses the principle of alignment in its design to create a clean, consistent, and visually pleasing layout. Alignment helps to organize the elements on the page and create a sense of order and balance. This makes the website easy to navigate and understand for the users. By aligning elements to a grid, Apple's website creates a sense of symmetry and stability, making the website feel well-organized and professional. This helps to create a positive user experience and makes the website more effective in communicating its message.</p>

                <p class="type-info">Facebook's login page may apply Hick's Law because it presents users with multiple options for logging in, such as using their email address and password, or logging in with their phone number. Additionally, it also offers the option to create a new account, or to find the account using their name or phone number. All these options can increase the time it takes for a user to make a decision on how to log in, which is in line with the Hick's law principle that the time it takes for a person to make a decision increases with the number of choices they have.</p>

The website also minimizes the distance between elements with a similar function in order to reduce the amount of time it takes for the user to interact with them. Additionally, Coolors.co utilizes the prime pixel and magic pixels to make sure that the interactive elements are easy to click and easy to find</p>
